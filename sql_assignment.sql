#1. Create a table called employees with the following structure;
 #emp_id (integer, should not be NULL and should be a primary key)`
 #emp_name (text, should not be NULL)`
 #age (integer, should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18)`
 #email (text, should be unique for each employee)`
 #salary (decimal, with a default value of 30,000).
#Write the SQL query to create the above table with all constraints.

create database Emp_details;
use Emp_details;
create table employees
(emp_id int primary KEY,
emp_name Varchar(30) not null,
age int check (age>17),
email varchar (50) unique,
salary decimal(10,2) default (30000));
#to check
select * from employees;

#2.Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity i n a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.
-- Answer- In databases,constraints help mantaining the integrity by limiting the type of data that can be inserted,updated or deleted.
-- common types of constraints- Primary key,Foreign key,unique,not null,check,default etc.

#3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.
-- Answer- Not Null constraint is used in a column if we do not want the values to be null that is there has to be some value that wll define column and show relation with other columns.
-- No, Primary key can not contain null value as primary key works as a unique identifier in a database. also it is used to establish relationship with other columns. 


#4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.
-- Answer- for adding--
-- 1. ALTER TABLE statement
-- 2. Specify table name
-- 3. Specify constraint type (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL)
-- 4. Define constraint details (e.g., columns, referenced table)
-- example-
-- CREATE TABLE customers (
--  customer_id INT,
--  name VARCHAR(95)
-- );

-- ALTER TABLE customers
-- ADD CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);
-- for removing-
-- 1. ALTER TABLE statement
-- 2. Specify table name
-- 3. Specify constraint type (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK)
-- 4. Specify constraint name (if known) or use system-generated name
-- example-
-- ALTER TABLE customers
-- DROP CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id;



#6. You created a products table without constraints as follows:
#CREATE TABLE products (
# product_id INT,
# product_name VARCHAR(50),
# price DECIMAL(10, 2));  
#Now, you realise that;The product_id should be a primary key.The price should have a default value of 50.00.

CREATE TABLE products (
product_id INT,
product_name VARCHAR(50),
price DECIMAL(10, 2));

alter table products change column product_id int product_id primary KEY;
alter table products change column price decimal(10,2) price default(50);

#7.
#Answer- The aspects of the tables are not matching. Two of them are about school ad on is about product.

#Normalisation & CTE

-- 1. First Normal Form (1NF):
-- a. Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you would normalize it to achieve 1NF.

-- The 'film' table violates 1NF because the 'special_features' column can contain multiple values.
-- To acheive 1NF of film table first we need to remove the special_features column from film table and then create another table like
 Create Table film_special_feartures (
    film_id int not null,
    special_feature varchar(100) not null,
    primary key (film_id,special_feature),
    Foreign key(film_id) references film (film_id) on delete cascade on update cascade
 );
 
 
 
 -- 2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
-- a. Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. If it violates 2NF, explain the steps to normalize it.

-- Ans -> There is no table in sakila database that violate 2NF except film table. As per the above answer if we able to normalise the table into 1NF then 
-- all non- key attribute in film table currently fully dependent on single-column primary key film_id. so there is no partial dependency.By this we can achieve 2NF




-- 4. Normalization Process:
-- a. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing it from the initial unnormalized form up to at least 2NF.

-- ANS
-- film table in sakila database violate 1NF because special_features column column can contain multiple values.So first we need to normalise it to 1NF
-- For that first we need to remove the column by doing following query

alter table sakila.film drop column special_features;

-- After that we need to create another table for special_features of film by doing following query
 Create Table film_special_feartures (
    film_id int not null,
    special_feature varchar(100) not null,
    primary key (film_id,special_feature),
    Foreign key(film_id) references film (film_id) on delete cascade on update cascade
 );

-- By executing the queries 1NF will be acheived

-- To achieve the 2NF we can check like :
-- all non- key attribute in film table currently fully dependent on single-column primary key film_id. so there is no partial dependency.
-- so 2NF is also achieved

 #a. Implement a recursive CTE to find all employees in the staff table who report to a specific manager, considering the reports_to column 

select * from staff;
with recursive staff_data as
(select staff_id,first_name,last_name,manager_id
from staff
where manager_id is null
union all
select s.staff_id,s.first_name,s.last_name,s.manager_id
from staff s
inner join staff_data sd 
on s.manager_id=sd.staff_id)
select staff_id,first_name,last_name,manager_id
from staff_data;
